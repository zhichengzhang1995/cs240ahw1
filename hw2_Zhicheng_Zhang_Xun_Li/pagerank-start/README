This is a startup directory for HW2

check.py
	-- Automatically check the running results with the expected results under test
	(1 iteations/10 iterations, test data are in data/simple*)
	-- This file involves some formatting feature not available in Python 2.6
	-- You may have to modify this code to match the environment at Comet or use
	a CSIL machine to test. 

data
	simple1, simple2, simple3 are 3 small test graphs. 
	The expected results are listed in  test directory.
	wiki is a wikipedia graph. 

pagerank
	The directory contains the  PageRank algorithm code. You only need to modify simple_page_rank.py

run_mock_pagerank.py
	The driver to call simple pageRank using a Fake RDD under a local Python environment.
	Formatting is simplified for Pyton 2.6 so it can work on Comet.
run_pagerank.py
	The driver to call simple pageRank using regular Spark RDD. 
	Formatting is simplified for Pyton 2.6 so it can work on Comet.
test
	The expected results for simple pagerank algorithm are listed for 1 and 10 iterations.

utils
	Supporting utilities including one that produces the names for wiki data from numbers.
